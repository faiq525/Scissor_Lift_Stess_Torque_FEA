 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 46 and contact element type 45 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 45.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Linear contact is defined
 Contact algorithm: Augmented Lagrange method

 contacting zone under small sliding assumption.  Redefine the pinball

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.
