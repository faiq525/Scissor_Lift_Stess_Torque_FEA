 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.125   TIME= 21:38:07
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.281   TIME= 21:38:07
 SOLID185 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.                                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.344   TIME= 21:38:07
 Meshes made up of 10 percent or more of SOLID185 tetrahedra are not     
 recommended.                                                            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.844   TIME= 21:38:08
 Material number 49 (used by element 153543) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.844   TIME= 21:38:08
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.391   TIME= 21:38:08
 Maximum contact stiffness 3.466239331E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      10.203   TIME= 21:38:14
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 8552).  Please check for an insufficiently    
 constrained model.
